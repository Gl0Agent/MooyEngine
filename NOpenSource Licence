#NOpenSource License v.1

Copyright (c) 2020 Al Saigon

SOFTWARE n shit.

NOpenSource license is to have culpability in software. 

Duty: You see somethings real fucked in the base, you immediately report it.

I don't give two shits what you do with it, you just agree to notify me in advance so we correlate.

v.1 - I hold veto authority. No one gives a shit about what I'm doing so I'm in control of it. Any addition is made through Al Saigon.
